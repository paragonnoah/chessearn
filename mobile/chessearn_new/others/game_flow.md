Chess Betting App - Game Flow Documentation
This document provides a detailed guide to the game flow of the Chess Betting App, including authentication, game creation, joining, moves, actions, queries, and real-time interactions via SocketIO. Each section includes API endpoints, SocketIO events, example curl commands, and responses to facilitate development and integration.
this base url may change https://api.chessearn.com cause we may test using localhost too, handle it universally for easy changing eg using .env
